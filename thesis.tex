\section{Introduction}
	In this paper, we'll explore the efficacy of using targeted keyword search queries to find architectural knowledge in mailing lists for open-source software projects. More simply put, we'll build tools, collect data, and analyze that data to qualitatively determine how effective certain keyword-based search queries are at finding useful information in large sets of emails, sent in mailing lists for developers to communicate about large open-source software projects.
	
	It is important to explore different avenues for acquiring knowledge, especially as the body of information grows exponentially with time. It is difficult for developers and software architects to make informed decisions about their own projects, because the source of their knowledge is distributed in a variety of disparate sources. If we can reliably glean information about software architecture and the successful (and unsuccessful) decisions that other field experts have made, we can make this knowledge more accessible for all.
	
\section{Related Work}
	This section will contain an overview of lots of different sources and what they've done, and how what I'm doing is different.

\section{Research Questions}
	The main research question that this paper attempts to answer is summarized in the following question:
	
	\begin{center}
		\large What is the effectiveness of using keyword search queries to find architectural knowledge in open-source software mailing lists?
	\end{center}
	
	In addition to the main question we're attempting to answer, this paper will also discuss several other possible questions and answers that may be obtained using the data originally gathered for the main question.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Does there exist a relationship in the order in which architectural decisions are discussed, chronologically in an email thread? Is there significance in the order in which architectural decisions are made?
		
		\item Is there a relationship between the content of discussion in emails, and related issues in issue/ticket boards such as \href{https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira}{JIRA} and \href{https://github.com/features/issues}{GitHub issues}?
		
		\item How can we use data gathered in this research to improve our search queries?
	\end{enumerate}
